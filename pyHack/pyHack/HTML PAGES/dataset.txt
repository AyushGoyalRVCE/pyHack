The workshop struck the perfect balance between informative and interactive. All the tips that were given felt directly applicable and often gave me that 'aha' moment where everything finally clicked. The facilitator did a great job to engage everyone - there was a lot to learn from him just by example - while never pressuring us to participate more than we were comfortable. I enjoyed this session very much!	1
The presentation was hopeless.	0

The content was not presented in the correct order.	0
Thank you so much for coming and delivering such a useful and engaging session. It was certainly in the spirit we intended.

We have had really positive feedback and people mentioned to me how valuable they found your session specifically.	1
The presentation has created a lot of confusion in the audience. So many lost interest in the presentation.	0

A lot of participants left in the middle of the presentation as it was very boring.	0
Thank you so much for the workshop earlier today, so glad I was able to book . I just wanted to let you know this was extremely helpful.

I just wanted to thank you for your excellent inputs [on various courses] over the last 9 months, and more recently this morning.

This has been invaluable to me and I will bring this knowledge with me when meeting with my research team in the future.	1
The seminar was not fruitful in any way.	0

I would never recommend this seminar to anyone.	0
Thanks very much for your course yesterday. I’ve attended similar courses before; yours was by far the most useful, memorable, and thought-provoking. I think it also showcased how education via Zoom can (and ought to?) be managed.	1
There are many better seminars than this one. Just wasted my time.	0
I found your session very fascinating and insightful and I have definitely received some tools that I will implement both when on the receiving and giving end of feedback.	1
There was nothing impressive about the session. It was of no help.	0

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G ! I was quite impressed about the energy and devotion of the presenter, you could tell that he was truly passionate about what he does and that itself is captivating!!!	1
I have been hearing only bad reviews about this seminar.	0
I am hearing some fantastic feedback about yesterday's workshop.  One student even said that you are the best presenter they have ever heard.	1
I could not reach out to any of the support staffs.	0
One of the best classes I've attended...ever.	1
I could not reach out to the presenters after the seminar.	0
Thank you so much for the training session...I really enjoyed and learnt lots from it.	1
The session was quite tiring.	0
This is quite refreshing...as we are often 'forced' to undertake statutory training sessions that are completely useless and irrelevant to what we do. This was an optional session, but it was the most useful I've had in the last eight years! So thank you!	1
The environment was not comfortable.	0
The most interesting, productive and enjoyable staff development event that I've ever been to. Thank you.	1
The whole workshop was not appealing to anyone.	0
Thanks for the inspiring talk and the wonderful workshop. It was given in a very visually appealing form. Who doesn't like to read interesting illustrations? It was very well designed, practical and valuable for anyone who wants to enhance their understanding about writing.	1
The content of the workshop was not nice. I don't think I will be able to apply it anywhere.	0
Just a few quick lines to thank you for the excellent seminar – Giving Presentations. It was absolutely superb. I’ve been to quite a number of these seminars on doing presentations (in a University as well as a business context) – but yours was the best one so far, by a long margin.	1

This was an extremely informative, enjoyable and above all valuable session and I look forward to putting some of the techniques I've learned today into practice.	1
Many thanks for the seminar today; I found it very interesting and incredibly useful. I’m about to transition from a senior PDRA to a tenure-track fellow so found everything particularly relevant to me. I will definitely put the ideas into practise.	1
Just wanted to say how good your workshop was. In fact, it's the best I’ve ever been to.	1
You could clearly see that the presenter was passionate about the subject and it reflected in the quality of teaching. Faultless.	1
Thank you for sharing an inspiring learning experience.	1
Many thanks for your brilliant session today. It must have been the best training session I've had throughout my study here.	1
Would I recommend this session? Unequivocally,of course - to any academic.	1
This was the most successful training event I have attended; your understanding of the challenges of our particular project and your skill in engaging the participants was outstanding.	1
It don't remember ever going on a course here where I stayed awake and alert and interested all day. I know this seems doesn't seem like much, but this was a great session. Thank you.	1
I just wanted to jot you a note of thanks to say how much I enjoyed your workshop this morning. It was certainly more lively and engaging than I had hoped for - how did you manage to bring such charisma to poster design?!	1
Just wanted to thank you for a great session - it has helped me focus and will be a great asset to me. I very nearly didn't attend because of a looming deadline , but I believe the hours spent will be repaid many times over!	1
Your first opening question changed my perspective on things entirely. Real insight and complete focus. Thank you.	1
Thanks so much for your session. It really motivated me to change my approach. I can honestly say that putting your tips and tools into practice made me feel more confident, helped me to get more feedback on my work from senior people and allowed me to figure out a networking style that I'm finally comfortable with.	1
Thanks again for today's workshop. I have attended several similar sessions in recent years. Yours is by far the best. Your approach has caused me to ask myself how to derive personal lessons from the material, and that has not happened very often before....	1
Thank you so much for the most interesting and inspiring workshop! I didn't only enjoy it but have tried to practise it. I felt lost in the midst of things and not sure what I was after. Now I feel more confident to do something. It's such a great feeling!	1
What struck me most was how aware he seemed to be of everything that was occurring in the room. The real benefit came where he managed to help us open up discussions of what everyone was thinking… but no one was saying.	1
I learned more in one afternoon with you than in the entire “Academic Development” programme that we are forced to do here. You’ve made me question my views on training. Thank you.	1
I found your session on Saturday very useful indeed, to the extent that I haven't stopped thinking and rethinking so much of what you said. I am already working on some short term objectives which I have set myself and have organised another meeting with my supervisor. I feel so much more positive and optimistic now and certainly have managed to get rid of that dreaded feeling of isolation which can really pull me down	1
I wanted to email you to say how interesting and informative I found the Giving Conference Presentations course yesterday. It was supportive, fun, answered all of my queries and provided more information on top. I would recommend this course for any academic	1
Thanks for all that has been organised in this wonderful event.	1
I’m just writing to say that, of all the sessions I’ve ever been to, this was by far the best.	1
Thanks for a really interesting day yesterday. Very interactive and tailored to what individual participants want.	1
The workshop was directed with real efficiency and yet, in the space of that relatively short time, you managed to achieve a warm and genuine relationship with each student, making us feel relaxed about airing problems and helping us arrive at possible solutions.	1
I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for this absolutely awesome session. I found the questions you asked and tasks you gave us very inspiring. I gained so much from it and my first half year of my PhD programme certainly would not have been the same without it! I kept minutes from the workshop which I still use.	1
Thanks for the session especially the part about career options after college. I was having a hard time about what I would do in the future. The ideas, tactics, techniques and support that I got from that afternoon were probably the difference between confused and clear.	1
Everyone here was wonderful, I had a lot of fun learning about myself- thanks! I would definitely come back and do another study in the future!!	1
My experience was great, everything was done in a timely fashion, the staff was courteous and friendly and they provided and cared for our needs.	1
Thought the staff was absolutely superb!!! Really enjoyed my overall experience!!!	1
It was a great experience for me and my daughter. It was very organized and everyone was just so sweet, kind and helpful.	1
I have LOVED LOVED LOVED the fact that my daughter could participate in this study. Everyone was great to my daughter (not surprised as they were great to me as well).	1
The staff was very professional and friendly and made me feel welcome and relaxed.	1
Everyone was very nice, very family oriented. I was not nervous, I was relaxed. The staff was kind, caring, sweet and sociable. I was relaxed during the two days. I was not stressed or anxious.	1
